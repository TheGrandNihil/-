[**The Deathworlders...**](https://deathworlders.com)
is one of the biggest, longest-running HFY sci-fi stories avalable. It focuses on a huge slew of characters as the universe evolves - it is compairable to the works done by such writers such as Isaac Asimov and CS Lewis. Most of Space is made up of Prey Species who are deathly afraid of humans as ultra-dangerous high gravity predators.
      
>The concept of a "deathworld" has existed in scifi at least since the series of novels by Harry Harrison published in 1960. The term describes a planet so utterly dangerous that any intrepid explorer setting foot on its surface is in grave and immediate peril. Virulent diseases, clawed predators, toxic plants or simply the harsh weather all pose an imminent risk of death.                                 
In The Deathworlders, Earth is one such planet. Humans just don't know any different because we've never lived anywhere else. Those species that have achieved interstellar travel on the other hand consider it impossible for sapient life to evolve on deathworlds, so when humanity shows up they are justifiably terrified of us. To them, we are monsters: Impervious to their weapons, strong enough to tear them limb from limb and capable of near-impossible feats of endurance. And that's to say nothing of the devastating bacterial and fungal plagues we carry naturally on our skin, nor our fierce intellect and contagious memes.                                                  
The oldest and most powerful interstellar civilizations count us as the gravest threat they have ever faced, and so mankind barely have time to set foot on the galactic stage before we find ourselves embroiled in a deadly fight for survival...A fight in which all our natural advantages may not be enough.

is a Monalith of a series that spans millions of words and countless in-universe genarations. It is probably my favorate Fimfiction of all time and sits next to the Deathworlders in scope and quality.

>Long Path, an earth pony living in Canterlot, and his best friend, a griffon named Free Agent, set out in the company of Twilight Sparkle to visit various places and species to look into what makes them different, and hopefully learn how to get along with them better. Things rarely go to plan though, and along the way, they discover things about themselves, and find love, drama, and laughter. Then Chrysalis changes everything, and the fate of the whole world might be at stake. Their lives will never be the same!

[**3.2**](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12768365/1/Nahoda-s-Gratitude) -
is my first fanfiction to have ever read. It is almost 2 million words all about the adventures of a group of prey-turned-predators as they deal with the consiquences of being choosers of the dead.

>A fateful wish causes horrific changes to our favorite seven dinosaurs. What will they do when they are forced to leave all they know behind and live an alien lifestyle in the mysterious beyond? What will they do when the hunted become the hunters? 

[**Bad Mondays...**](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/163706/bad-mondays) is an epic tale of a violent human mercinary as he gets griffon friends, and kills monsters. He has to deal with is meat-eating habits.

>Handy is not a happy man at the best of times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               He was even less happy to find himself in an alien world that offended the very laws of physics and got injured for his own stubborn refusal to accept the obvious path fate had apparently laid out for him.                                                                                                                                                                                                     For his trouble he is now on a journey, with the long term goal of finding his way back home, only to find himself involved in plots and machinations so far above his head and cares that he quickly becomes a pawn in a game played by powers who care not for his well-being.                                                                                                                                  Quite like his life back on Earth if you think about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                Needless to say, Handy does not care for any of it. He is much more preoccupied with the more immediate and pressing mundane concerns of day to day life a human needs to worry about while in Equestria.                                                                                                                                                                                                              Obtaining a new pair of shoes for example.																													All this and one almighty hangover, what's the worst that could happen?

[**The Man With Two Names**](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19300/the-man-with-two-names) Is the story that got my into fimfiction to start with. Its all about a Human who, starving, consumes one of Fluttershy's chickens.

>When Fluttershy finds a human in her backyard trying to eat one of her chickens, she and a majority of the residents of Ponyville only want this dangerous creature as far away from their town as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                           After a less than stellar first impression, Derpy Hooves and the human struggle to quell the rumors surrounding his diet, and convince the townsfolk that he's harmless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Will the human be able to make himself meek enough to coexist? Or will he be driven out of town with torches and pitchforks?

is my first ever fimfic, and the story that made me make my account. This monster of a book rivals the Harry Potter Series in terms of legnth, and is well written through and through. It took me many of weeks to finally complete this series

>I'm Griffin, not much else to it. I've been bullied most of my life, which left me bitter and sarcastic. I'm a closet brony. What? You think I'm just gonna go out and tell a world that hates me that I watch a cartoon intended for little girls? I don't feel like giving the punks at school any more ammo. That's when cosmic powers decide I need to take a trip to my favorite fantasy land. But all is not sunshine and rainbows and it certainly won't be after I'm done with it. Equestria from the point of view of an extremely pissed off teenager, with a twist.

is a massive series written over the course of 3 years. All about a strange deer that apears out of nowhere one day, this story follows his adventure as he kills enimies, befiends a bear, and has a family. Some of the later stories follow the misadventures of his children and grand-children.

>In his classic story, 'Bambi,' Felix Salten set the tale in the German woods of the late 19th to early 20th Century. Bambi and his friends are roe deer. How they related to the other animals and Man is the crux of the story. I am changing that somewhat and putting Bambi in as a North American Whitetail deer somewhere in the forests of the Southern USA. Time period is the 1930s to 1940s. There is no specific place I have in mind for the story. It is a mix of locations I have visited during my life. I am doing this because I think most of my readers will be American and therefore might relate more to this setting rather than some story that took place in the early 1900s in a location that most likely got chopped down ages ago. In this story, I am relining on both Walt Disney's film mixed with a heavy amount of Salten's original work. His books were favorites of mine when I was between 6-10 years old. You will see some familiar characters here, but you will not see all of them from the movie and book. The logic I used for this story is that whoever can best advance the story will be use. Those characters that do not advance the story will remain out. There is also an attempt to increase the impact of the story by giving the reader information they may not have been exposed to before. Whereas every kid in my generation saw Bambi the movie as they grew up, I doubt if many of us read the books by Salten. The author encourages you to read the original work by Salten. I am hoping to capture the flavor of both book and film with this tale. I hope you enjoy it.

[**The Carnivores Prayer**](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/37761/the-carnivores-prayer) is a beutifual one-shot that packs more emotional punch than some novels.

>The gryphons were not always monsters. That came later.                                                                                In the earliest days, they were our friends. They flew alongside pegasi. They shared the land with earth ponies. They studied beside unicorns. There was no fear between us. That came later too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Time drew our people apart, but it was not time that made them monsters. They made that choice themselves; they chose their fate. And it was the greatest gryphon who sealed it.                                                                                             

[**The Tale of the Hippogriff**](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/264802/the-tale-of-the-hippogriff)
When it comes to adventure stories, there are certain qualities you look for. Compelling characters with goals to strive towards, tight pacing, a plot with multiple twists and turns, and an ending which leaves the reader wholly satisfied. OleGrayMane’s The Tale of the Hippogriff has all of these and more. Its main protagonist, the titular hippogriff, Celia, flies off to parts unknown in an effort to locate her long-lost father and mend her mother’s fragile heart. Along the way, she discovers aspects of herself she never knew as well as the true natures of war, magic, and the hearts of men (er, ponies and griffons). Emotions run strong, from love and hate to tragedy and triumph. A relatively compact read at less than 65,000 words, OleGrayMane crams in more depth than most authors can in four times that length, creating a mythical story of manageable proportions.
This tale is one to remember.

>On a blustery winter's night in the ancient Unicorn Kingdom, a storyteller tries to touch the heart of his inebriated queen and her court with a tale of love and loss that he himself believes is myth: The Tale of the Hippogriff.

[**Cartography of War**](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/171675/cartography-of-war)
is a story is very near and dear to my heart, it is focused around two characters, the kind and compassionate pony Compass Rose, and the noble Gryphon hunter Gérard. Their species are at war with eachother, and while one still views the other as prey, they are forced together by circumtance. 
      
>The war touched everypony, even those far from the fighting. Compass Rose was affected more than most when gryphons appeared far behind the front lines, and the aftermath left her unwillingly in the company of an enemy soldier.

is a great little series about a changling that got abandoned by her hive for writing daring doo fanfiction... she then goes on to save the world with daring doo - great little story.
>Like most ponies, Maxilla the exiled changeling doesn’t believe that Daring Do is real. However, fate seems determined to prove her wrong in the most dramatic way possible.

is a awesome little tale about a human that got trapped in equestria, and had to live off of the land to survive. As he is living with the wolves, ponies study him.

>For many years there has been a mysterious creature living in the woods. Many rumors have spread about this creature. Some say its capable of killing anything it puts its mind on, even predators many times its size. A very strange creature that nopony had ever encountered face to face. That was, until now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The story will tagged complete, since I don't have anything more to write. If I do get an idea for another chapter it will be published here.

[**Tears of a Sharptooth...**](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12402863/1/A-Wish-Granted-Tears-of-a-Sharptooth) is an amazing story that takes a very intresting take to Rombus's "Seven Hunters" universe. All about when herbavores are forced to live as predators, and the moral coniquences of it.

>Do we truly know our friends unless we walk in their footsteps? What happens when Littlefoot and the gang are forced into a life that threatens to eliminate their sanity, and yet must walk in until they know what it means to be what they fear? A riveting tale full of adventure, danger, heartbreak, and friendship. 

[**The Wolf and the Lamb**](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2302440/1/The-Wolf-and-the-Lamb) is a story that I read many years ago, far far back in my youth. I was 13 maybe 14 when I found this wonderful tale of interspecies romance between a wolf and a ram.

>A lot of people don't like one or more of those. Nothing too graphic, though. An epic fairytale of cross species love, the 'ship between predator and prey, and other pretentious sounding things.

[**The Way of the Forest**](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13268368/1/Bambi-The-Way-of-the-Forest-Edition-2) It is a great story recreating the original book that the bambi movie was based on.

>This is the continuation of the story that was written by Felix Salton. I beefed up my original story and added parts where I thought the story was thin. I also added another character's point of view. I hope you like it. I have written it in long form with one chapter. Let me know what you think.

>Long ago, the Burning Queen drove the Sons and Daughters of Fenris from Equestria into the Great Northern Forests.                      A year ago, the Night Mare vanished from the Moon and the sun did not rise for days. Puzzled and fearful, the Alphas of the Packs sent scouts south into the Pony lands to seek whether what was foretold was coming to pass. One of these scouts traveled farther into Equestria than any Wolf had in a thousand years.           
This is the story of what happened

is a quite intresting story about a former human turned genetically-engineered-super-preadator that ends up in equstria.

>I wasn't always like this, a monster, running through the woods on an alien planet. I was once a man. I had dreams, a girlfriend, and a great job.
Then They came. In the middle of the night, They scooped me from my home, and... changed me.                                           Now I'm a beast, a demon the like of which the world I've become stranded on has never seen before, scraping by on the fringes of society, hiding from the natives, and doing my best to avoid notice.                                                                    After all, who could ever be friends with a monster?

[**The Carnivores Counsule...**](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/433618/the-carnivore-council)
is a cute little story about a wolf kidnapping a pony, only to end up as allies against the world.
      
>In the 900th year of the Celestial Era, crown land was given to a group of pilgrims to start a new life.                                                          In only a short couple of years the Smith family carved their home out of the Everfree and established Sweet Apple Acres. Before long others began to search for their own new start in the fledgling town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Now all were warned about the dangers of the forest, and that it was not fit to enter but the Everfree does not yield its ground easily, and the denizen's of that place are feeling the pressures of an ever decreasing habitat.                                            
Not all the stories of those early pioneer days survived the inexorable passage of time. Some prefer they were forgotten.

# Teir 3 - Enjoyable

[**Bambi: Child of Man**](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3710944/1/Bambi-Child-of-Man) is an adorable oneshot about Bambi finding a human child lost in the woods.

>An adult Bambi finds a small boy lost in the woods. Will he help him, or will his hatred of Man get the better of him?

[**Home**](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/417814/home) is a story all about A human finding a vamperic friend in a world that hates meat-eaters.

>After waking up alone and trapped in Equestria, I found myself treated with noticeable caution by its inhabitants. Not that I blame them; I am a predator species after all, but that still doesn’t make it easy. Will I ever find my place in this world? Turns out I may not be so alone in my struggle for acceptance. Following Luna’s return, the bat-ponies are also faced with adversity and although most ponies see their return as ultimately positive, it only takes a couple bad apples to spoil the bunch. We are all individuals, with strengths and weaknesses and should treat each other as such. Unfortunately, not everypony sees it that way and although it’s natural to group yourself (and others) together, it’s still ultimately harmful.

[**Reflection**](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13322955/1/Reflection) is a cute little fluf one-shot about Gabu (A wolf) and Mei (A goat) after they escape over the mountains.

>Now that they finally have all the time and space on their paws that they could ask for, Gabu and Mei decide to sit down and discuss their options for the future. A short coda to the anime, "Arashi No Yoru Ni / One Stormy Night".
